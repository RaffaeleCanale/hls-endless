It has four audio/video bitrates and one audio-only.\r\n\r\n##Install HLS-Endless\r\n```Bash\r\nnpm install hls-endless -g\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Starting the application\r\n```Bash\r\nhls-endless start\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Stop the application\r\n```Bash\r\nhls-endless stop\r\n```\r\n\r\n##The resources are avaiable:\r\n\r\n* Multi bitrate, variant playlist: [http://localhost:6060/master.m3u8](http://localhost:6060/master.m3u8)\r\n* Single bitrate: [http://localhost:6060/bitrate_[0-4].m3u8](http://localhost:6060/bitrate_[0-4].m3u8)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Video provided by Apple\r\nThe video used is [Apple’s 4x3 basic stream](https://developer.apple.com/resources/http-streaming/examples/) example with 4 bitrates. The full video is around 30 minutes long but since I didn’t want the repo to be huge, I only used 3 minutes and 30 seconds of it. This should be fine since the video will loop forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How I Set It Up To Run Locally?\r\nRequirements: *Confirm you have Node v0.10 or superior installed.*\r\n\r\n####Step 1: install all required npm modules\r\n\r\nWithin the project directory:\r\n\r\n```Bash\r\nnpm install .\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Step 2: Run the tests\r\n```Bash\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
